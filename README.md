## Technologies Learned
### **Tailwind**

    Learning Tailwind from the ground up proved to be an exciting endeavor.
    The simple act of styling components with pre-built classes is something very fast and 
    easy to learn I could work for extend periods of time without needing to think much about
    Mobile compatibility or browser compatibility. Tailwind does it for you out of the bag
    and I'm glad that I've learned how it works.

### **Typescript**
    While having a hard time grasping how typescript works, I think that it saved me the time
    from debugging how the API works by giving me warnings and type checking without even the 
    need to strictly specify the shape of the data that I need. The inference system that Typescript
    has is very handy for it alone and can save you hours of headaches with its safety net.
    I've learned that I should make some things optional and some things required with Typescript,
    to make my app security more robust. While albeit I am still learning how it works on a more advanced
    level theres is no doubt in my mind that I will be using Typescript on a project whenever I can.
    It is simply too great of a technology to pass up and not learn in my opinion.
